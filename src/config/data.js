    "Enactus Fest is a celebratory event where the members of the society get together to organize Mega Events to promote the rich culture and the spirit of Enactus KISS-KIIT. The main motive of the Fest is to celebrate past achievements and learnings and create a deeper bond and understanding among the members of the organization. This is the platform where we showcase our warmth and hospitality towards people outside the organization. With the inception of The Enactus Festival 18”, enactus kiit celebrated societal change and empowerment of lives through entrepreneurial action and us (en-act-us). During the course of the event an open mic and a seminar on Social Entrepreneurship were organized. The open mic was organized with the idea of believing in the ability to make a difference, we are all walking on the same planet after all and giving is hands-down the most impeccable feeling in the world; it's a feeling that soothes others, as well as ourselves.",

    "Enactus-KISS KIIT conducted an event “into the woods” on the occasion of our 9th Founders day and aimed to contribute towards a healthy and sustainable environment.  We pledged for a better world for us all through a large scale tree plantation drive by an organization that thrives to add the green back to the Earth. “Into the woods” was a combination of the drive and fun activities like photo booth and a theme based life size snakes & ladder game. An outreach program, 'A Tree for a Pledge, Enact-us', was also celebrated with the objective of bringing people together for greater causes. On this occasion, the students created awareness about the Australian wildfires and the importance of keeping nature intact. More than 400 pledges were taken by the students at the university. The program was well received at the university.",

    "Menstrual Hygiene (MH) has been continuously gaining visibility and importance in humanitarian relief and development. MH-issues and responses are inherently inter-sectoral, and offer remarkable opportunities for cross organizational, international and multi-sectoral cooperation to address this critical dignity issue for menstruators around the globe Enactus KISS-KIIT, in collaboration with KIIT Wordsmith, Kimaya, and Kamakshi,  embarked on a quest to de-alienate menstruation, and build a healthy period culture. Mypadmystory campaign was initiated with the aim to create awareness about menstruation. We saw a lot of inspirational stories and debunked a lot of myths during the course of this campaign. A fun quiz was also organized for the team members that educated us through the objective.Period.

The event was very well attended and was indeed a successful one.",
